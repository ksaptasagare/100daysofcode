# oops in python

OOPs stands for object oriented programming, and python is an object oriented language. Thus, it is important to know what and how oops work in python.

Some OOP concepts in python are as follows:

1. Class: A class is a blueprint / template. It is generic in nature, and it describes two things - the form an object created from it will take (properties) and functionality it will have (methods). It bundles data and functionality together =. 

2. Objects: Objects are an instance of class. Thus, they are specific in nature. The process of object creation is termed as instantiation.

3. Inheritance: Inheritance is a property when a class can take on all the methods and properties from another class. It is used when there's a `like a` relationship between two classes. 
    Eg.: Manager class can inherit Employee class.
    Types: Simple, Multiple, Multilevel.
    Classes: Base(Parent / Super), Derived(Child / Sub)

4. Containership: Containership is similar to inheritance, except it is used when there's a `has a` relationship between two classes.
    Eg.: Employee class can contain Department class.

5. Method Overloading: It is the process of redefining a pre-defined method in base class or an inherited method in derived class to perform a class specific task. 

Everything in python is an object.
