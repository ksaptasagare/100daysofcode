# 100daysofcode
This is my attempt at doing the coding challenge. Hopefully, I'll be consistent.

day1.py - a game of rock, papers and scissors 

day2.py - a simple code to calculate the age

day3.py - number guessing game limited to 5 tries

day4.py - countdown timer with time(seconds) as input

day5.md - went over the basics of python oop (__init__, __sizeof__, __str__, __hash__)
